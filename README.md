# EtherPlay - Ethereum Price Guessing Game
Welcome to the Ethereum Price Guessing Game, a fun and engaging way to test your prediction skills and win some cryptocurrency in the process! This smart contract-based game allows users to submit their guesses for the price of Ethereum every 15 days, and the participant who guesses the correct price wins the entire pot.

# How to Play
To participate in the game, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Connect your MetaMask wallet to the Polygon testnet network.

Step 2: Navigate to the top of the website and click on the "Faucet" button to receive fake USDC tokens.

Step 3: Approve the contract to deposit your USDC by clicking the "Approve" button.

Step 4: Submit your guess for the price of Ethereum every 15 days and deposit 5 USDC into the prize pool to participate.

Step 5: Wait for the end of the guessing period to find out if you're a winner!

The more participants in the game, the larger the prize pool grows, making it even more exciting to participate. Once the 15-day window is up, the smart contract automatically checks the current Ethereum price and determines the winner. If there is no winner, the prize pool rolls over to the next round, making it even larger and more enticing for the next round of participants.
